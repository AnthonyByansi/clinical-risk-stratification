# Clinical Risk Stratification Project
The Clinical Risk Stratification Project aims to develop a model that can predict a patient's risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). This can help healthcare providers intervene early and prevent adverse outcomes, leading to improved patient care and reduced healthcare costs.

## Data
The data used in this project will be collected from electronic health records and other relevant sources. The dataset will include patient demographics, medical history, and other factors that may be associated with the risk of hospital readmission.
