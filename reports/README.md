# Reports
This directory contains the reports generated during the Clinical Risk Stratification project. The reports document the various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Report Types
Several types of reports were generated during the project, including:

* Data exploration reports that provide insights into the data, including distributions, correlations, and outliers.
* Preprocessing reports that document the steps taken to preprocess the data, including imputation, scaling, and encoding.
* Feature engineering reports that document the selection of features that were used in the final models.
* Model selection reports that document the process of selecting the best models for predicting the risk of hospital readmission for patients with CHF.
* Model evaluation reports that document the performance of the selected models using various metrics.

## Report Formats
The reports were generated in various formats, including:

* Jupyter notebooks that document the code used to generate the reports and visualizations.
* PDF documents that provide a summary of the main findings and insights.
* HTML documents that provide an interactive way to explore the data and models.

## Report Usage
The reports can be used to gain insights into the data and models used in the Clinical Risk Stratification project. The reports can also be used to reproduce the analysis and results presented in the project.
