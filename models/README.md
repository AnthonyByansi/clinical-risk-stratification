## Models
This directory contains the trained models developed for the Clinical Risk Stratification project. The models were developed using machine learning algorithms and were trained on preprocessed patient data to predict the risk of hospital readmission for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

## Model Types
Several machine learning algorithms were explored in this project, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost

Each of these models were trained and evaluated using various performance metrics to determine which models perform best for predicting the risk of hospital readmission for patients with CHF.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using several metrics, including:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* AUC-ROC
The evaluation results are documented in the `reports` directory.

## Model Usage
The trained models can be used to predict the risk of hospital readmission for patients with CHF using new patient data. To use the models, the preprocessed patient data must be fed into the trained models, and the models will output the predicted risk of hospital readmission.

## Model Deployment
The models can be deployed as a web application using Flask or other similar web frameworks. Once deployed, the application can be used to predict the risk of hospital readmission for patients with CHF using patient data entered by the user.

## Model License
The models developed in this project are free to use and can be modified or distributed as long as appropriate credit is given to the original authors. The models are provided without warranty or guarantee of accuracy or fitness for any particular purpose.
