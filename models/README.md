## Models
This directory contains the trained models developed for the Clinical Risk Stratification project. The models were developed using machine learning algorithms and were trained on preprocessed patient data to predict the risk of hospital readmission for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).

## Model Types
Several machine learning algorithms were explored in this project, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost

Each of these models were trained and evaluated using various performance metrics to determine which models perform best for predicting the risk of hospital readmission for patients with CHF.
