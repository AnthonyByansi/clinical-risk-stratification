## Data
This directory contains the data used in the Clinical Risk Stratification project. The data consists of electronic health records and other relevant sources that provide patient demographics, medical history, and other factors that may be associated with the risk of hospital readmission for patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).
## Data Sources
The data was collected from several sources, including:

* Electronic health records from hospitals and clinics that treat patients with CHF
* Patient surveys and questionnaires that provide additional information about patients' health status, lifestyle, and other factors
* Publicly available datasets from research studies or government agencies that contain information on patients with CHF. 

## Data Preprocessing
Before the data can be used in machine learning models, it needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. The preprocessing steps included:

* Cleaning the data by removing irrelevant or duplicate records
* Dealing with missing values by imputing or removing them
* Handling outliers by capping or removing extreme values
* Encoding categorical variables as numeric variables
Scaling the variables to ensure that they have the same range and unit of measurement


## Data Description
The final dataset used in the project consists of X records and Y variables. The variables include:

* Patient demographics such as age, gender, and race
* Medical history such as comorbidities, medications, and previous hospitalizations
* Laboratory tests such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels
* Other factors such as lifestyle habits, socioeconomic status, and social support
